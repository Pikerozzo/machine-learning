# A Machine Learning project: regression and classification

This project focused on analyzing and modeling the "Insurance" dataset. The dataset includes attributes such as age, sex, BMI, region, number of children, smoking status, and insurance charges.

The objectives of the project were:

- Perform data analysis to uncover insights and patterns.
- Develop regression models to predict insurance charges.
- Build classification models to predict smoking status.

The dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance).

## Repository Structure

- **insurance.csv**: Dataset in CSV format.
